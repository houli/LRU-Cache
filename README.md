# LRU and pseudo LRU Cache
An implementation of a cache with both LRU and pseudo LRU replacement policies.

## Download
If you do not want to build the program there is a release on the [Releases page](https://github.com/houli/LRU-Cache/releases).  
Download it and then run `java -jar Cache.jar` to run it.

## Building
Building requires the ant build tool. A Java 8 JDK is also required due to use of modern features such as lambdas and streams.  
`ant` will compile and run the JAR file.  
`ant build` will just build the JAR file.
